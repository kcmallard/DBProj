			Welcome to our website! You're really going to love it here. You'll never regret signing up for this site. We save your information in a database so you'll never forget it! You can save:
		</p>

		<li>
			 <b>Your phone number!</b>
		</li>

		<li>
			 <b>Your credit card number!</b>
		</li>

		<li>
			 <b>Your identifying information!</b>
		</li>

		<p>
			"But hey Maria and Kyle, why do I need this service to store all of that for me??"
		</p>

		<p>
			We store all of this information for you, so you'll never have to carry around a bulky phone, an annoying credit card, or a disappointing birth certificate ever again!
		</p>

		<p>
			"But wait a second... doesn't this increase the chance of PII being leaked to the public?"
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, yeah. But, we here at neverforget.com realize how much more important conveniance is compared to security.
		
		<p>
			Sometimes, we even have a working phone number so that you can get a hold of us whenever you may have any issues with our services! Please remember to leave positive reviews for us, or you may be subject to a small fine ;)
